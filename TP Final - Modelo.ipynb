Los inmuebles que están eu una misma coordenada de latitud y longitud pueden tener una gran variación de precios dependiendo de otros factores como la infraestructura de la zona. Además, estas variables podrían estar fuertemente correlacionadas entre sí ya que se refieren a una localización geográfica.\n","\n","*Fecha de Publicación:* puede no tener una relación directa con el precio de la propiedad. El precio de venta es más sensible a factores como la ubicación, el tamaño y el tipo de propiedad, En particular, la información analizada fue en 2019 / 2020 y los precios de las propiedades se vieron afectados temporalmente por la pandemia que generó cambios en la demanda, ajustes de precio e incertidumbre económica.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"E8VGnFsssjsA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**División de Datos (Train-Test Split)**\n","La división entre los conjuntos de entrenamiento y prueba:\n","•\t70% para entrenamiento permite que el modelo tenga suficiente información para aprender patrones complejos.\n","•\t30% para prueba garantiza que haya suficientes datos para evaluar el rendimiento del modelo en datos no vistos, lo que es clave para medir la capacidad de generalización del modelo.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"z7Pbz-_Jslhc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Modelos Analizados**\n","El modelo inicial elegido fue Regresión Lineal debido a su simplicidad.\n","Regresión Lineal: asume que la relación entre las variables independientes (como superficie, tipo de propiedad, etc.) y el precio de la propiedad es lineal.\n","Random Forest (modelo por defecto): los resultados mostraron mejoras en comparación con la regresión línea\n","Random Forest (más árboles): utiliza 500 árboles para mejorar el rendimiento,\n","Random Forest Optimizado: por úlitmo, se probaron tres configuraciones optimizadas de Random Forest con diferentes combinaciones de hiperparámetros.\n","\n","**Métricas de Evaluación Utilizadas**\n","\n","El RMSE es útil para evaluar modelos donde se desean predicciones lo más precisas posible.\n","\n","El MAE mide el error promedio entre las predicciones y los valores reales.

Rendimiento Aceptable con Menor Costo Computacional: aunque RF optimizado C y Random Forest con 500 árboles ofrecieron un mejor rendimiento, ambos modelos son más costosos computacionalmente. Random Forest (default) es un modelo con un rendimiento competitivo, lo que lo convierte en una excelente opción cuando el costo computacional es un factor crítico. Ofrece un buen equilibrio entre precisión y velocidad de entrenamiento.\n","\n","2. Simplificación del Proceso: los modelos optimizados de Random Forest (como RF optimizado C y RF 500 árboles) requieren ajustes adicionales de parámetros como número de estimadores y profundidad máxima entre otros, lo que hace que el proceso de optimización sea más largo y dependiente de más pruebas. Por otro lado, Random Forest (default) usa parámetros estándar que aún ofrecen un buen desempeño en este caso y su simplicidad facilita la implementación rápida sin la necesidad de ajustes exhaustivos.\n","\n","3. Buen Rendimiento Sin Necesidad de Ajustes Avanzados: presenta un RMSE y MAE competitivos demostrando que el modelo puede predecir bien el precio de las propiedades sin los costos adicionales de optimización. Es  la fase inicial de modelado y se logra obtener resultados rápidos, antes de considerar modelos más complejos.\n","\n","4. Comparación de Resultados: en el análisis comparativo de resultados, aunque RF optimizado C obtuvo el mejor rendimiento en términos de RMSE y R², la diferencia con Random Forest (default) no era lo suficientemente significativa como para justificar la complejidad adicional del modelo más pesado. El tiempo de entrenamiento y el tiempo de predicción fueron considerablemente más rápidos para Random Forest (default).\n","\n","\n","**Conclusión**\n","La elección de Random Forest (default) fue justificada por su buen rendimiento en comparación con modelos más complejos, así como por su eficiencia computacional. Este modelo proporciona un equilibrio adecuado entre precisión y costo computacional, lo que lo hace una opción ideal para entornos donde se requiere un modelo eficaz sin comprometer demasiado los recursos de cómputo.\n","\n","RMSE = 59,488 dólares, este valor sugiere que hay algunos errores grandes ya que el RMSE penaliza los errores grandes de manera más severa.\n","\n","MAE = 39,689 dólares: en promedio, el modelo se equivoca en 39,689 dólares por predicción, sin importar la magnitud de los errores.\n","\n","Esto sugiere que hay algunos outliers en las predicciones. En el primer paso probé diversas maneras para reducir los outliers y la utilizada fue la que consideré mejor para el modelo sin reducir significativamente la base.\n","\n","El modelo explica aproximadamente el 68 % de la variabilidad de los precios. Los errores absolutos siguen siendo significativos, por lo que las predicciones individuales pueden diferir bastante del valor real. No obstante, esto es normal en datos inmobiliarios, donde intervienen muchos factores difíciles de modelar. Hay que tener en cuenta que hay factores no incluidos en los datos, por ejemplo disponibilidad de amenities, antiguedad y estado del inmueble entre otros.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Xahy6I35sujV"}}]}
